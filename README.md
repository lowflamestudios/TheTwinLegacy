# TheTwinLegacy
A currently abandoned Godot Engine project meant to be an RPG similar to the likes of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door and Bug Fables that we may pick up again sometime in the future, but only time will tell.
The original development team consisted of FiralTheSpiral and Jenga With Wet Wipes, two high school friends.
# Why Firal Quit (for now)
Firal is currently working full time and has lost motivation to work on the game with hope to get that motivation back. See what he's up to [here](https://fts.lowfla.me).
# Why Jenga Quit (for now)
Jenga quit because Firal was the only one with a bit of GDScript know-how, and Firal lost motivation.
